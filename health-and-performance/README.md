# Health & performance summary
This is an example dashboard to give a quick, non-detailed overview of the server health & performance. It shows a few high-level key elements to keep an eye on, without providing an unnecessary amount of detail. This dashboard is best used passively, just to keep an overall eye on the system.

## Requirements
The following ServerStatistics global tags are required;
* `serverstatistics_server` - Indicates which server should be inspected.

If you do not have these tags, you must configure them in your ServerStatistics plugin or modify the dashboard to modify another tag or to remove the tag entirely.
